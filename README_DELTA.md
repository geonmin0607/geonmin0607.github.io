# Delta overwrite (what changed)
- Removed **date & author** from all cards (`_includes/card.html`).
- Ensured custom CSS is loaded (`_includes/head/custom.html`).
- Switched homepage to **left photo + right intro** hero and **wider 3-col** cards (`index.md`, `assets/css/portfolio.css`).
- Added soft borders and tidy hover for cards.
